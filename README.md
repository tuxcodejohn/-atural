# Natural
Small helper to use natual number template library

## What is it?
nat.H is a simple template header-only library, that helps you to use natural numbers in your C++ code.

You can simply use
```
	â„•<17> 
```
to refer to  the 17th natural number.

Finally no more error prone hand application of Peano's axioms!!
